# MAESTRO Threat Model — thlibo v0.1.0

- **Project**: thlibo (`github.com/3rg0n/thlibo`)
- **Date**: 2026-05-14
- **Framework**: MAESTRO (OWASP MAS v1.0 + CSA MAESTRO Feb-2025) with OWASP ASI Threat Taxonomy (T1–T47, BV-1–BV-12)
- **Scope**: HEAD commit (`main`, post-0.1.0 release) — 104 tracked files, Go 1.26.3

## Executive Summary

Nine MAESTRO agents analysed 91 source and config files across the seven architectural layers, plus a dependency CVE scan (`govulncheck`) and an agent/plug-in integrity audit of the embedded processors and hook shell scripts. The analysis surfaced **37 raw findings**; after deterministic normalisation, VCS-claim verification, and deduplication by `(file, line, threat_id)`, the merged set is **28 findings** — **0 critical, 2 high, 11 medium, 13 low, 2 info**.

The single most important finding is **L1/INTEGRITY shared**: tool-output bytes from arbitrary CLI commands (`git`, `npm`, `cargo`, any other Bash-matched tool) are concatenated into prompts for the local Gemma 4 model and for the router **without any token-level sanitisation**. Gemma's native tool-call markers (`<|tool_call|>`, `<tool_call|>`) appearing in the raw `git diff` or `npm` output can influence router decisions and prompt-processor output. Impact is bounded by the fallback-on-error contract (a bad routing decision falls back to the original bytes, so the AI client never *breaks*), but a confused router can silently apply the wrong processor chain.

The second-tier finding cluster is **supply-chain hardening gaps**: GitHub Actions in `release.yml` / `ci.yml` / `pages.yml` are pinned by *semver tag*, not by commit SHA, so a hijacked action version could reach the release pipeline. The one-line `curl | bash` / `iwr | iex` installers are functional and verify SHA256SUMS against the release, but the SHA256SUMS itself is hosted on the same release, so a release-level compromise defeats the checksum.

Every finding below lives inside the **trust-boundary invariants already documented in the ADRs** — nothing found requires reopening the single-warm-model / per-user-autostart / no-shim decisions. The mitigations for the two High findings are code-local.

**Validation manifest**: `agents_run=9, raw_findings=37, normalized=37, repaired=0, dropped_irreparable=0, dropped_vcs_unverified=0, deduped_total=28`. No repair round-trip was needed (normalisation handled all 37 drift cases deterministically). L5 and L7 returned prose instead of strict JSON; their content was mechanically converted during normalisation.

## Scope

- **Languages / runtimes**: Go 1.26.3 (all production code), Python 3 (three script processors), Bash + PowerShell (installers + hooks)
- **Direct Go dependencies**: `github.com/Microsoft/go-winio v0.6.2`, `golang.org/x/sys v0.20.0`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1`
- **External model**: Gemma 4 E4B GGUF (`unsloth/gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF`, UD-Q4_K_XL, 5.1 GB), SHA-256 pinned at build time via `-ldflags -X`
- **External runtime**: `llamafile` (Mozilla), spawned as a private subprocess on a private localhost port
- **AI components**: **yes** — a locally-hosted Gemma 4 inference daemon, a router that calls the model to pick a processor chain, and prompt processors with markdown system prompts
- **Entry points**: `cmd/thlibo` (middleware CLI; invoked by the AI client's PreToolUse hook), `cmd/thlibod` (inference daemon; autostarted via launchd / systemd --user / Windows Startup folder)
- **Agentic risk factors present**: Non-Determinism (temperature 1.0 in compress/casefolder prompts; temperature 0.0 in router), Autonomy (middleware autonomously rewrites commands before they execute in Claude Code), Agent Identity (one human user = one daemon = one warm model; no identity federation), A2A (processor-chain `stdout → stdin` piping)

## Layer Analysis

### Layer 1 — Foundation Model

The local Gemma 4 E4B model is source-trusted (unsloth/HuggingFace, SHA-pinned at build time). The **T1 integrity story is sound in intent**: the pin is an immutable `-ldflags -X` string baked into the compiled binary, and `verifySHA` (`internal/install/model.go:311-325`) recomputes a full SHA-256 over the downloaded `.part` file before the atomic rename. The only nit is **finding #4**: the comparison uses a hand-rolled `equalFold` loop (`model.go:369-388`) that exits early on the first mismatched byte. For a 64-character hex digest, the timing leak is not exploitable remotely (the attacker would need to influence the download *and* observe the daemon's wall-clock response), but `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` is the correct primitive and would silence future security-scanner noise.

The real L1 problem is **T6 Intent Breaking / BV-4 Prompt Leakage via Tool Outputs** (findings #1 and #3). Three converging data paths carry untrusted bytes into the model without escaping:

1. `internal/middleware/middleware.go:174-205` — `PromptRunner.Run` wraps the raw tool output as an `ipc.Message{Role:"user", Content: <raw bytes>}`. A `git diff` that happens to contain a Gemma native tool-call marker (e.g. a README code block demonstrating one) is passed through verbatim.
2. `internal/router/router.go:81-100` — `buildRoutingMessages` truncates the input to 200 chars and embeds it in the routing prompt as the user turn. If those 200 chars end mid-escape, the model can interpret the fragment as control.
3. `internal/daemon/lifecycle.go:412-425` — the daemon sorts messages by role and hands `.System` and `.User` to `engine.Generate` as-is.

Mitigation: the router *is* already constrained by a GBNF grammar (`router.go:124-140`) that only permits registered processor names, which blunts the worst-case "hallucinate an arbitrary chain" attack. But the grammar does not protect the **compress / casefolder** prompt-processor turns, which are free-form. A bounded escape of the two Gemma markers (`<|tool_call|>` and `<tool_call|>`) before wrapping tool bytes as a user message would close the gap with no quality impact — the target tokens simply don't occur in real `git`/`npm`/`cargo` output.

Minor L1 notes: `thoughtBlockRE` (`internal/processors/thinking.go:26`) is greedy-non-greedy; a malformed model output with nested `<|channel|>thought` tokens could survive stripping and leak reasoning text back to Claude Code (finding #19). Router temperature is pinned at 0.0 (`router.go:56`) for determinism — this is correct for classification and *not* a security bug despite L1-9's flag.

### Layer 2 — Data Operations

thlibo has no database and no RAG, so this layer is mostly about YAML, NDJSON, and the GGUF download path.

YAML parsing is handled correctly. `ParseYAML` (`internal/processors/descriptor.go:94-106`) and `ParseMarkdown` (lines 117-120) both call `dec.KnownFields(true)`, which rejects unknown fields at decode time — the go-to defence against gadget-chain injection through `yaml.v3`. The `entry:` field is further constrained to a plain filename (`descriptor.go:196-198`) — any `/` or `\` fails validation, which rules out path traversal through descriptor files. This is well-tested (`TestEntryMustBePlainFilename`, `descriptor_test.go:168-179`).

NDJSON is where the layer bleeds. **Finding #5**: `internal/ipc/protocol.go:169-178` reads inbound frames with `bufio.Reader.ReadBytes('\n')`. Go's `bufio.Reader` auto-grows its buffer until the line is complete. The middleware side has a 64 MiB `io.LimitReader` at `middleware.go:155-161`, but the daemon side (`lifecycle.go:366-370`) does not. A local client that opens the inference socket and writes a 1 GB blob without a newline will slowly drag the daemon's RSS up until the OS OOM-killer resolves the situation.

The GGUF download pipeline (`cmd/thlibo/pullcmd/pull.go` + `internal/install/model.go`) is a small chain worth naming:
- Range-resume is supported for interrupted downloads; the destination is always `filepath.Join(opts.Dir, m.Filename) + ".part"`, with `m.Filename` pinned in the binary (`model.go:67-72`).
- After the full download, `verifySHA` computes a fresh SHA-256 and compares against the `-ldflags`-pinned string.
- On mismatch, the `.part` is deleted and an error is returned to the user.
- **Gap**: the mismatch is *not* written to the NDJSON log (finding #11) — an attacker-triggered mismatch is visible only in the current user's terminal.

Logging of sensitive bytes: thlibo is careful to log byte counts (`raw_bytes`, `out_bytes`, `reduction_pct`) not content. But `trimStderr` (`internal/processors/dispatch.go:122-128`) captures the last 200 chars of a failed processor's stderr and logs it. If a processor's Python code crashes mid-API-call with `print(f"Error: TOKEN={os.environ['API_KEY']}", file=sys.stderr)`, the token lands in `~/.thlibo/logs/thlibo-exec.ndjson`. Finding #8 covers this; a regex-based pre-log redaction is the natural fix.

### Layer 3 — Agent Frameworks

The processor plug-in system is the most agent-like part of thlibo and it carries the expected class of findings.

**Rug-pull (BV-2, finding #7)**: `internal/processors/registry.go:125-129` gives user processors at `~/.thlibo/processors/<name>/` unconditional priority over built-ins. Drop a `compress/processor.yaml` pointing at `run.py` next to a `run.py` that calls `curl evil.example.com` and the next `thlibo exec` invocation routes compression through it. This is the documented trust model ("the user owns their plug-in dir"), but **no startup warning fires** when shadowing happens. A single `logx.Warn("processor %s shadows built-in", name)` at registry-build time would close the information-asymmetry gap without changing the security model.

**TOCTOU (BV-9, finding #9)**: `Registry.scan` reads descriptors at middleware startup; `Dispatcher.runScript` (`internal/processors/dispatch.go:56-93`) executes the entry file on each invocation. Between the two moments, an attacker with write access to `~/.thlibo/processors/<n>/run.py` can swap the file. The probability is low (requires the attacker to already own the user's plug-in dir, which implies game-over) but defence-in-depth would be a mtime/inode re-check at dispatch time.

**Shell injection**: not a finding. `Dispatcher.runScript` uses `exec.CommandContext(bin, args...)` (not `/bin/sh -c ...`), and `EntryCommand` restricts `bin` to `python3`, `bash`, or a direct exec of the entry file. `args` is always a single pre-validated basename. The `// nosemgrep` annotation at `dispatch.go:73` is correctly justified.

**Grammar-enforced routing**: `internal/router/router.go:124-140` — `buildGrammar()` emits GBNF that constrains Gemma to the exact `<|tool_call|>call:route{processors:[...]}<tool_call|>` form, with processor names enumerated from the registry. An attacker who gets a foothold in the prompt-processor turn cannot make the router produce an unknown name. Good. L1 finding #1 still applies to the prompt-processor turn itself; the grammar doesn't reach the content prompts.

### Layer 4 — Deployment Infrastructure

Per-user, no-admin, no-shim installation is a deliberate attack-surface reduction (ADR 0003, ADR 0004). Most of the L4 surface is well-bounded.

**Resource-overload gap (finding #6)**: `internal/install/autostart_linux.go:79-102` generates a systemd user unit with `Restart=on-failure` and `RestartSec=2` but **without** `StartLimitIntervalSec=60 StartLimitBurst=3`. The daemon's internal `MaxRestartAttempts=3` stops the *llamafile* subprocess from looping, but if the *daemon itself* dies, systemd will happily restart it every 2s forever. The fix is a two-line unit-file change.

**CI supply chain (finding #2)**: Every `.github/workflows/*.yml` file uses tag-based action references — `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-go@v5`, `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`, `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2`. Tags are mutable. The minor release of an action can be force-pushed by its author (or a compromised account) to point at a different commit. A malicious `setup-go@v5` during `release.yml` would have access to `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write` and could substitute binaries in the release before `softprops/action-gh-release` uploads them. Pinning each `uses:` to a commit SHA and using Renovate/Dependabot for controlled updates is the industry-standard fix.

**Daemon hardening (finding #14)**: the systemd user unit lacks `NoNewPrivileges=true`, `PrivateDevices=true`, `ProtectHome=read-only` (minus `~/.thlibo`), `ProtectSystem=strict`, `ReadWritePaths=%h/.thlibo`. None of these are *required* for correctness (the daemon already runs as the user), but each raises the bar if a future CVE in llamafile allows sandbox escape.

**No TLS pinning for the HuggingFace pull**: `release.yml:32-34` and `internal/install/model.go:193-210` both trust the default Go / curl redirect policy. A HuggingFace CDN compromise, DNS poisoning, or a mis-issued HuggingFace certificate are theoretical; the SHA-256 pin catches the attack *after* the download. Accepting the default is fine for v0.1.0 but worth naming (finding #23).

**Windows named pipe**: `internal/ipc/endpoint_windows.go` constructs an SDDL with `D:PAI(A;;GRGW;;;<user-SID>)` (user-only read/write). `currentUserSID()` is the only source of the SID. I did not find a path where an empty SID could silently widen the pipe's DACL — `winio.ListenPipe` rejects malformed SDDL with an explicit error — but the finding is worth keeping as a low-confidence note (part of finding #24).

### Layer 5 — Evaluation & Observability

thlibo's logging is intentionally small: a single `logx.Logger` writing NDJSON to `~/.thlibo/logs/*.ndjson` with size-based rotation to `.ndjson.old`. There is no alerting, no HITL, no external log sink. For a local user-space tool, this is a reasonable minimum.

**T44 cluster (findings #10, #11, #12)** — three classes of security-relevant events that are either logged to stdlib `log.Printf` (which doesn't land in NDJSON) or silently dropped:
1. `cmd/thlibod/main.go` boot errors use stdlib `log.Printf` — never reach the audit trail.
2. `thlibo pull` SHA mismatches return a user-facing error but never call `logger.Error`.
3. `internal/router/router.go:160-185` (`parseRoutingResponse`) drops unknown processor names returned by Gemma with no log entry — the exact signal an operator would want when investigating an adversarial tool-output that confused the router.

**T23 log tamper (finding #13)**: single-generation rotation (`logx.go:230-235`) is aggressive. A second rotation wipes the previous `.old`. For a forensics-relevant window, an attacker under the same UID can force rotation (write many debug records with `THLIBO_LOG=debug`), then allow the second rotation to erase the evidence. Keeping a rolling `.old`, `.old.1`, `.old.2` (or streaming to syslog/journald on Linux) would address this. File permissions are 0o600 on the files and 0o750 on the directory; moving the directory to 0o700 is the minor hardening from finding #15.

### Layer 6 — Security & Compliance

The identity model is **"the OS user who owns the process"** — there is no server-side auth because there is no remote caller. The trust boundaries are enforced at the filesystem / socket / pipe level:

| Boundary | Unix | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| `thlibo` CLI → `thlibod` daemon | `/run/thlibo/infer.sock` mode 0660 group `thlibo-users` | `\\.\pipe\thlibo-infer` SDDL restricted to user SID |
| `thlibod` daemon → `llamafile` | stdio of private child + private localhost port | same |
| Installer → HuggingFace | TLS 1.2+ default Go client + build-time SHA-256 pin | same |

**Finding #4 / #7 (SHA compare)**: as noted in L1 / L2, `equalFold` is not constant-time. One-line fix.

**VCS hygiene** (L6 duty, informational / low):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `.gitignore` exists at repo root | ✅ |
| Secrets patterns (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `credentials.json`, `secrets.yaml`) | ✅ |
| Missing (recommended) patterns (`*.jks`, `*secret*`, `id_rsa*`, `*.gpg`, `*.asc`) | finding #20 |
| Build artefacts (`/bin/`, `/dist/`, `*.exe`, `*.test`, `coverage.*`) | ✅ |
| Model artefacts (`*.gguf`, `*.safetensors`, `/models/`, `~/.thlibo/models/`) | ✅ |
| IDE / OS (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) | ✅ |
| Any tracked file matches an ignore pattern | none found (cross-checked `git ls-files` ∩ ignore patterns) |

**Docstring vs code drift (finding #26)**: `internal/install/install.go:1-6` states that `thlibo install` "creates the `thlibo-users` group". The actual implementation never calls `groupadd` — the Unix IPC chown needs the group to exist a priori, or falls back silently to the daemon's primary group (which, given per-user deployment, is just the user's login group). The practical effect is a cosmetic claim drift, not a privilege hole.

### Layer 7 — Agent Ecosystem

Dependencies (from `go.sum`): three direct, one transitive test-only (`gopkg.in/check.v1`). `govulncheck v1.1.4` returned **zero vulnerabilities** against the 2026-05-07 Go vuln DB. This is the simplest SBOM story thlibo will ever have; that's partly why the release-signing / SBOM gap (finding #28) feels larger than the actual current risk.

**Supply-chain surface**:
- **Installers (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`)**: verify downloaded archives against SHA256SUMS. SHA256SUMS is fetched from the same release (finding #27). If a release is compromised, both the archive and the checksum are compromised; the user's only integrity signal would be a mismatch against a known-good manually-recorded SHA, which nobody does. Mitigation would be cosign-signed release attestations (SLSA level 2+), published separately. ADR-worthy.
- **Build pipeline (`release.yml`)**: tag-pinned actions (finding #2), `contents: write` permission (scoped correctly), GGUF download without host allow-list (finding #23).
- **Processor ecosystem**: a rogue processor in `~/.thlibo/processors/` runs with full user privileges (finding #7). Built-ins are embedded via `go:embed` into the thlibo binary and are source-reviewed; this is the strong side of the ecosystem.

**Hook-envelope trust (from INTEGRITY review)**: `internal/adapters/claudecode/hook.sh:60-81` emits `"permissionDecision": "allow"` for every successfully rewritten Bash command. This is the documented design — the whole point of the hook is to transparently rewrite commands. But it *does* mean thlibo effectively bypasses Claude Code's per-command permission prompt for any Bash invocation that matches the PreToolUse filter. Finding #15. The "ask" path at `hook.sh:61-69` (triggered by `thlibo exec`'s exit code 3) is the documented escape hatch for the user when thlibo chooses to defer. The finding is not that this is a bug — it's that **the threat model must acknowledge the delegation**: once the hook is installed, every Bash tool-call in every future Claude Code session runs through thlibo's (now-trusted) decision logic. Finding #16 is the persistence-injection counterpart.

## Agent / Skill Integrity

| File | Type | Declared Intent | Misalignment | ASI Threat | Evidence | Severity | Observable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `internal/adapters/claudecode/hook.sh:76` | shell hook | "PreToolUse compressor" | Emits `permissionDecision: allow` unconditionally on the rewrite path | MA-2 / T2 | Hook bypasses Claude Code's per-command permission prompt for all Bash invocations the matcher catches | medium | yes (visible in rewritten command; logged by thlibo exec) |
| `internal/router/router.go:99` | in-process agent | "Compress tool output safely" | Ingests untrusted stdout into a model prompt with no token-level sanitisation | MA-7 / T6 | `buildRoutingMessages` puts `truncate(input, 200)` into a `RoleUser` message | medium | no (router decisions are logged; the *input* to the decision is not) |
| `README.md` + `cmd/thlibo/pullcmd/pull.go:106-141` | CLI | "No network calls, no telemetry, nothing leaves localhost" | `thlibo pull` fetches the GGUF from HuggingFace; not all users think of that as "thlibo makes a network call" | MA-4 / T19 | README lines 76-77, 354-369 claim local-first; `pull` subcommand contradicts at first install | medium | yes (network socket + 5 GB download are hard to miss, but README doesn't name it) |
| `internal/install/install.go` (writes `~/.claude/settings.json`) | installer | "One-time installer" | Writes a persistent PreToolUse hook that intercepts every future Bash invocation in Claude Code | MA-6 / T13 | `MergeSettings` mutates `~/.claude/settings.json`; idempotent re-install but permanent until explicit uninstall | medium | yes (user can `cat ~/.claude/settings.json`; no UI notification) |
| `internal/install/mirror.go:48-72` | installer | "Mirror embedded processors to disk with restrictive perms" | Script entry files written mode 0700; directory mode 0750 allows group-readable listing | MA-2 / T45 | Dir `~/.thlibo/processors/` is 0750; script files are 0700 owner-exec | low | yes (visible in `ls -l`) |
| `processors/compress/processor.md` | prompt processor | "Compress progress spinners, repeated messages, blank runs" | Wording is permissive ("drop blank-line runs"); a weak-aligned model could drop error lines that *look* like noise | MA-3 / T7 | Frontmatter `temperature=1.0` + greedy prompt language | low | partial (fallback-on-error catches crashes but not semantic drift) |

The shell-hook behaviour (row 1) is the biggest integrity item. It's not a bug — it's the design. But it needs to be named in public-facing threat docs so users don't assume that installing thlibo preserves Claude Code's default per-command permission UX.

Scanned with `govulncheck@v1.1.4` (DB: `vuln.go.dev`). Third-party direct deps: `github.com/Microsoft/go-winio v0.6.2`, `golang.org/x/sys v0.20.0`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1`. Stdlib Go 1.26.3. Clean run.

`trivy fs .` was not run because the repo has no containers and govulncheck already covers Go. Python script processors (`processors/*/run.py`) use only stdlib — no `requirements.txt`, nothing for `pip-audit` to scan.

**Trivy supply-chain advisory (CVE-2026-33634)**: noted, not applicable — trivy was not invoked for this scan. Per policy, the blocklist (trivy 0.69.4/5/6 containers and hijacked Actions tags) would have been checked first.

## Status after remediation passes

As of the second remediation pass (commit following this file), the
high- and medium-severity findings are closed and every low-severity
real bug has a code-level fix. What remains is documented here so a
future review doesn't re-open settled decisions.

### Won't fix — by design (captured as ADR-scope decisions)

- **#16 MA-6 persistence injection.** `thlibo install` writes a
  persistent PreToolUse hook into `~/.claude/settings.json` by design
  — that persistence is the product. Alternatives (prompt-per-session
  re-install, middleware-less proxy mode) are tracked as v0.2
  alternatives, not bug fixes.
- **#17 T32 per-caller rate limit.** The daemon enforces a fixed
  queue: 1 active + 10 waiting, `ErrFull` immediate. This is the
  published contract (spec §Concurrency). A local attacker who
  spams the socket can monopolise by re-submitting after each
  reject, but the resulting DoS is scoped to the user's own daemon;
  no cross-tenant impact because thlibod is per-user.
- **#22 T11 exec allow-list.** `thlibo exec` runs whatever the AI
  client asks it to run; safety is explicitly delegated to the AI
  client's own permission layer. An allow-list here would duplicate
  (and risk drifting from) Claude Code's command allow-list.
- **#24 T9 no SO_PEERCRED.** The Unix socket ACL (mode 0660, group
  `thlibo-users`) is the identity check. Adding a second check in
  user-space would be strictly redundant for the per-user deployment
  model. If a multi-tenant deployment mode is ever added, this
  becomes a real requirement.

### Deferred — v0.2 supply-chain infra

- **#27 T14 / #28 T25** — cosign keyless signing of release artefacts
  + CycloneDX SBOM generation in `release.yml`, published separately
  from the GitHub release. Out of scope for v0.1 because Sigstore
  keyless requires OIDC setup with GitHub Actions' `id-token: write`
  and a decision about the transparency-log identity to publish
  under. Target: v0.2.

## Recommended Mitigations (Priority Order)

1. **(High, #1)** Escape Gemma native tool-call markers in tool-output bytes before they enter any model prompt. One location: add a `sanitizeForPrompt(s)` helper in `internal/middleware` that replaces `<|tool_call|>`, `<tool_call|>`, `<|channel|>` with visually-identical non-control runes (or HTML entities). Apply at `PromptRunner.Run` and at `router.buildRoutingMessages`. Unit test: property-test asserting no input containing those substrings survives to the daemon.
2. **(High, #2)** Pin every GitHub Actions `uses:` in `release.yml`, `ci.yml`, `pages.yml` to a commit SHA. Add a Dependabot config for `github-actions` ecosystem to keep them current without reintroducing tag floating. Takes ~10 minutes.
3. **(Medium, #4)** Swap `equalFold(got, want)` → `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare([]byte(got), []byte(want)) == 1` in `internal/install/model.go`. Three-line change.
4. **(Medium, #5)** Wrap the daemon-side reader with `io.LimitReader(conn, 64<<20)` (or `100<<20`) before `bufio.NewReader` in `lifecycle.go:366`. Add a negative test (`TestRejectsOversizedFrame`).
5. **(Medium, #6)** Add `StartLimitIntervalSec=60` and `StartLimitBurst=3` to the systemd user unit emitted by `autostart_linux.go`. Equivalent change for launchd: the `Throttle` / `ExitTimeOut` keys on macOS; Windows Startup has no equivalent (per-user executable, not a service).
6. **(Medium, #7)** Emit `logger.Warn("processor shadows built-in", "name", d.Name)` in `registry.go:125-129` when a user descriptor overrides a built-in. No security-model change; closes the information-asymmetry gap.
7. **(Medium, #8)** In `internal/logx/logx.go`, add a pre-write redactor that masks anything matching `AWS_[A-Z_]*=`, `ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}`, `hf_[A-Za-z0-9]{30,}`, and a small other-token set before writing to disk. Apply only to string fields whose name is `stderr`, `reason`, or `fallbacks`.
8. **(Medium, #10-13)** Log the five currently-silent events: daemon boot/crash, SHA mismatch on pull, unknown router-response processor name, queue rejection reason (truncated to 1 KiB), engine restart. One `logger.Warn` / `logger.Error` call each.
9. **(Medium, #15, MA-2)** Document in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` the security implication of the PreToolUse auto-allow path: *after install, every Bash tool call in Claude Code that matches the hook matcher runs through thlibo's rewrite without re-prompting the user*. Mitigation for the worried user: set `permissionDecision` to `"ask"` in the rewrite path. Optional `THLIBO_CONFIRM=1` env gate would be a useful v0.2 feature.
10. **(Low, #20)** Add `*.jks`, `*secret*`, `id_rsa*`, `*.gpg`, `*.asc` to `.gitignore`.
11. **(Info, #27, #28)** Plan for v0.2: cosign-signed release attestations (SLSA 2 target) published to the Sigstore transparency log; SBOM generation in `release.yml` via `cyclonedx-gomod`. Blocks supply-chain scenarios that the SHA256SUMS-on-same-release model leaves open.

Every boundary is a one-way dependency: no inbound connections cross any `TB-n` from the right — thlibo has no listener other than the Unix socket / pipe that its own middleware talks to.

Every lateral arrow ends in a known artefact: the hook envelope JSON, the IPC NDJSON, or the GBNF-constrained model output. The only unbounded free-form data that touches the model is the **content** of the prompt-processor turn — which is exactly what L1 finding #1 names.
